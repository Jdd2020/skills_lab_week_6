# skills_lab_week_7
This a repository for the skills lab in week 7 of the CMPINF0010 course.

## Description
The python program attached to the project first tells the user what the program does and then asks whether
the user wants to enter frequency or wavelength. Once the user enters that question it prompts for a value to be entered.
Then the program goes through a long if-chain to figure out what type of wave was entered and then prints the type of wave to the user.

## Intsallation
The programs can be used by simply dowloading the Python file and using the Python shell to run them.
After, all that needs to be done is entering the values that are being prompted for.

## Usage
This program could be used to quickly figure out the type of wave something after observing its wavelength of frequencies.
This could be used in real lab aplications or for something as simple as homework.

## Contribution
You can help this project by expanding the uses of this code to include more functions or build a better way to import 
the project. When contributing or using our code in the project, please follow our code of conduct and license agreement.
