# skills_lab_week_7
This a repository for the skills lab in week 7 of the CMPINF0010 course.

The python program attached to the project takes a user's name and profession and
slowly prints out the combination of the two letter by letter, creating a somewhat 
satisfying presentation on the console.
Also, nameAndAge takes in user name and age and tells you how old you will be in 17 years.
