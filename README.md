# skills_lab_week_7
This a repository for the skills lab in week 7 of the CMPINF0010 course.

## Description
The python program attached to the project takes a user's name and profession and
slowly prints out the combination of the two letter by letter, creating a somewhat 
satisfying presentation on the console.
Also, nameAndAge takes in user name and age and tells you how old you will be in 17 years.

## Intallation
The programs can be used by simply dowloading the Python files and using the Python shell to run them.

## Usage
The first Python program takes a two String inputs, name and title, and prints to the user console one letter interation.
Specifically you enter your first input using keyboard input and then hit enter ENTER. You then repeat this for the second
input and your output is printed.

The second Python program takes String and integer input in a similar process to the first program. To finalize each keyboard
input, use the ENTER key. After going through this process, the output is printed.
