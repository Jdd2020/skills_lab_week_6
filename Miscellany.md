# Miscellany

First and foremost, we did not write our own code of conduct and license because, honestly, we are not well-versed in copyright law. We also chose two of the most popular licenses and code of conducts because, if they are so widely used, they must hold some merit and therefore, are more than qualified for our hypothetical project.



### The Unlicencse

We chose the unlicense because we wanted the code to free as possible. So we went beyond what is free in the eyes of open source and made our hypothetical project public domain with this license. Further, we wanted to make the project public domain because we have no intentions to profit off this project in any way and wanted other people to use the code contained in the project as they see fit. The idea of public domain was also interesting, as it makes the project the property of the collective public and this property is interesting because it brings the social/political idea of collectivism into the programming world. This license allows our project to be public domain, letting anybody do whatever they want with our code because it is technically public property.



### Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

For our code of conduct, we chose the Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct.  Unlike the license, where we chose it for the idea, we are choosing this code of conduct because of how universal it is. This code is one of the most popular in the world, with it being used in many small projects, such as our own, and much larger projects, such as Google or git.  In addition to its popularity, we chose it because it promotes good behavior in our software by having unacceptable behaviors, means of varied enforcement, and a list of encouraged behaviors to foster a positive community. This code of conduct is highly established through all levels of the programming and promotes a positive community around a project.
